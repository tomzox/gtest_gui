General:
- code comments
- test suite at least for filter_expr & gtest parser

gtest:
- import of trace with core: executable not linked & not cleaned upon trace removal
- import of trace: executable file & ts is unknown:
  Add "info" file to directory, or encode name in sub-directory path (hash);
  prerequisite: allow only one exe per directory even if timestamp equal
- handle I/O error in trace writing
- after crash: check if core dump is enabled, add warning to trace file
- if /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern pipes to apport: copy core from /var/lib/apport/coredump/
- unit-test on many CPUs: GUI is overloaded => throttle updates of result log
- optimize TC allocation per CPU: consider actual duration
- restart test job after crash of a test case (problem: cannot change filter
  without affecting gtest's "sharding", i.e. CPU partitioning)
- Repeat with the actual SEED value (not supported by gtest)

main:
- import trace upon start: use separate thread
- add menu cmd for trace import from file
- support gtest input via socket
- hide test_ctrl: switch status_line to wid_test_log

wid_test_ctrl:
- enhance popup_test_list for case that there's single test suite
- option to make tc filter-string case-independent? (problem: gtest compatibility)
- win32: hide core & valgrind options

wid_test_log:
- menu for result mgmt: remove selected, all old passed, all filtered;
- when removing traces: rewrite trace files to actually remove text?
  OR: new command for "compressing" trace files
- add key binding for toggling repetition mark on selected test cases
- allow adding bookmark / attaching note to result log entries

dlg_browser:
- trowser command argv: use shell if cmd contains space or special chars; check if escape needed
  or add config option
- export trace files in other archive formats, or uncompressed to directory

dlg_config:
- extend option for cleaning trace upon exit: Radiobutton all/failed-only/ask
- add option: Save test control settings when quitting?
- add option: Reg.exp. for extracting failure line
  requires to parse all traces after changing expression to update file/line of exception
- upon window close: ask for saving pending changes

filter_expr:
- use wildcard at front or middle to minimize name length
- check_pattern: offer automatic correction (e.g. case)
- replace use of Tcl "string match" for gtest filter globs

dlg_tc_list:
- update column widths after font change - same for dlg_job_list
- add footer containing sums: #test cases, total pass/fail, exec time, #enabled
- folding: show test suite names only (possibly controllable individually?)
- add column showing skip count
- enable sort via click in column head / via ctx menu
- entry field for filtering by name

dlg_job_list:
- use mclistbox (multi-column listbox, available in Tcl/Tk)
- allow sending KILL signal to job
- show %CPU read via /proc (Linux only)

dlg_help:
- text search
