General:
- documentation
- code comments
- test suite at least for filter_expr & gtest parser
- python package

gtest:
- hard link for exe as "exe.exe_ts" to allow recompilation during run
  keep link as long as there are core files referencing it
- handle I/O error in trace writing
- during import: for CRASHED logs, import core files names core.trace.*
- after crash: check if core dump is enabled, add warning to trace file
- unit-test on many CPUs: GUI is overloaded => throttle updates of result log
- optimize TC allocation per CPU: consider actual duration
- restart test job after crash of a test case
- Repeat with the actual SEED value (not supported by gtest)
- Feature: "Compressing" trace files by removing traces of passed test cases

main:
- import trace upon start: use separate thread
- add menu cmd for trace import from file
- support gtest input via socket
- hide test_ctrl: switch status_line to wid_test_log

wid_test_ctrl:
- enhance popup_test_list for case that there's single test suite
- option to make tc filter-string case-independent? (problem: gtest compatibility)

wid_test_log:
- result log: shows "old exe" for results generated by different executable (path)
- configure menu: configure font for trace preview text widget separately

dlg_browser:
-! command line config: use shell only if contains space or special chars; check if escape needed
- clean up browser & gdb temporary input files
- use matching exe for opening core
- export trace files in other archive formats, or uncompressed to directory

dlg_config:
- Option: Clean pass trace files or all trace files when exiting GUI
- Option: Automatically import traces in specified directory upon start
- Option: directory used for storing trace files
          create sub-directory for each new exe?
- Option: Save test control settings when quitting?
- Option: Reg.exp. for extracting failure line
  requires to parse all traces after changing expression
- add button next to path entry widgets for opening file browser
- upon window close: ask for saving pending changes

filter_expr:
- use wildcard at front or middle to minimize name length
- check_pattern: offer automatic correction (e.g. case)
- replace use of Tcl "string match" for gtest filter globs

dlg_tc_list:
- update column widths after font change - same for dlg_job_list
- use same font for header as for content
- add footer containing sums: #test cases, total pass/fail, exec time, #enabled
- folding: show test suite names only (possibly controllable individually?)
- add column showing skip count
- enable sort via click in column head / via ctx menu
- entry field for filtering by name

dlg_job_list:
- use ttk TreeView
