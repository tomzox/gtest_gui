''', 'indent'), ('''One problem arises when the number of test cases is smaller than the number of CPUs. This typically occurs, when trying to run a single test case many times. Sharding would then only use a single CPU, as it does not consider repetitions in its "sharding" algorithm.

In the mentioned example, it would not use sharding, but instead run half the number of repetitions in one process, and the second half in the second. For more complex configurations such as 10 repetitions of 9 test cases on 8 CPUs, a combination of both methods will be used.

As the "sharding" algorithm uses static partitioning solely based on the number of test cases per process, differences in execution times are not considered.
